Command line tools in different scripting languages dedicated to making my life easier while being cool af.

<b>Future Plans</b>: I will be adding a setup.py to make setting this up and installing it much simpler. For now, just copy
the code.

<b>Cler</b> and <b>Scraper</b> both contain tools that scrape a website and return a text version of it. Cler does this by iteslf while Scraper uses an outside website to do so which has the benifit of providing a better service, but is protected by cloud flare so you have to install a couple of extra modules. More details in the folders.
